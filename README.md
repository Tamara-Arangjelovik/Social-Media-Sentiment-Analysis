Sentiment-Analysis

These scripts collectively provide a robust framework for collecting, processing, and analyzing social media data from Twitter and YouTube. They enable researchers to gather data, clean and prepare it, analyze sentiments, and visualize results. They are particularly useful for understanding how people engage with and react to topics like the Ukraine-Russia war and other trending topics across different platforms.

Python Script for Collecting Tweets:
This script collects tweets about Ukraine using Twitter’s API to understand public opinion during a specific time frame, focusing on English-language tweets and excluding retweets. It saves the data in a structured format for further analysis. It utilizes libraries like datetime, json, and Twarc2 to interact with Twitter’s API and handle data efficiently. Authentication is done using a Bearer Token, which acts as a key to access Twitter’s API. The script targets tweets posted between February 24, 2022, and March 2, 2022, and searches for tweets containing the keyword "Ukraine" in English, filtering out retweets. The collected tweets are saved in a .jsonl file (ukraindatadump.jsonl) and converted into a .csv file (ukraindatadump.csv) for easier analysis in tools like Excel.

R Script for Text Mining and Visualization:
This script processes and analyzes tweet data using text mining techniques and creates visualizations like bar plots and word clouds to uncover patterns and trends in the text. It allows you to load a CSV file containing tweets into a data frame called UKTwit and converts the tweet text into a corpus. The script cleans the text by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation, numbers, and common stopwords, and eliminating extra whitespace. It creates a Term-Document Matrix (TDM) to show how often each word appears in the tweets. Visualizations include a bar plot displaying the most frequent words and a word cloud where the size of each word corresponds to its frequency. An advanced word cloud is also created using the wordcloud2 package, offering an interactive, star-shaped visualization with a black background.

R Script for Collecting YouTube Comments:
This script gathers and organizes comments from YouTube videos using the vosonSML package and saves the data to a CSV file for further analysis. It uses the vosonSML package to collect and analyze social media data, prompting you to install it if not already installed. Authentication is done using a YouTube API key, which you must provide. The script specifies a YouTube video by its ID and collects comments and replies, storing the data in a variable called ytdata. The collected comments are saved into a CSV file (ukraindatadump-youtube.csv) for easy access and analysis. The script also displays the structure of the collected data and provides a preview of the first few rows.

R Script for Sentiment Analysis on Tweets:
This script analyzes the emotions and sentiments in tweets about the Ukraine-Russia war using the syuzhet package and visualizes the results with a bar plot. It uses the syuzhet package for sentiment analysis, along with libraries like ggplot2 and dplyr. The script lets you select a CSV file containing tweets and loads it into a data frame called mf. It cleans the tweet text to ensure compatibility with the sentiment analysis functions. The get_nrc_sentiment function classifies each tweet into 10 sentiment categories (e.g., joy, anger, fear, trust) based on the NRC Emotion Lexicon. A colorful bar plot is created to display the total count of each sentiment category across all tweets.

R Script for Sentiment Analysis on YouTube Comments:
This script performs sentiment analysis on YouTube comments about Ukraine, similar to the tweet analysis script, but tailored for YouTube data. It uses the syuzhet package for sentiment analysis and other supporting libraries. The script lets you select a CSV file containing YouTube comments and loads it into a data frame called mf. It cleans the comment text for analysis and applies the get_nrc_sentiment function to classify each comment into 10 sentiment categories. The results are stored in a data frame, and a bar plot is created to visualize the sentiment scores, offering insights into the emotional tone of the comments.
